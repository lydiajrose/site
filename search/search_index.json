The two below are the ones I found the most rewarding. DITA Project In working on my DITA project I not only learned a lot about new tools, but also about writing process information. In order for you to document a process in DITA, you have to break the process up into smaller portions since DITA tasks are only used for specific tasks as in it won't accept certain types of content. This means that you can't just put everything into a singular DITA task. This forces you to break things up more and formulate the process in a more bite-sized, digestible portions. Click on the link below to view a PDF version of my final DITA project. DITA Project MN Austin Healey Club Website One of the most rewarding projects that we did this semester was revamping the MN Austin Healey Club's website. As you can see below, the original site was functional, but rather busy and not the most streamlined or aesthetic. Our main goal in our redesign was to make the website as user friendly as possible since most of the potential users of the site tend to be older and not always the most technically savvy. We also needed a site that was more mobile friendly. As it was, the original site had a fixed size and would not adjust to the size of the user's browser window. This made using the site somewhat tedious. Our final product was not perfect (in no small part to the limitations of our chosen CMS Wordpress.com), but I feel that our final product was at the very least a significant improvement on the former site. Compare the two websites for yourself by clicking on the links below.

Looking back I'm a little shocked by how many new tools and skills I learned in such a short amount of time. Looking over my first ever assignment for this class, I realized just how far I've come. The New Digital Literacy I had mentioned in my initial Digital Literacy narrative that it is difficult to use or write documentation about technology when you have never used it before. You often find yourself needing to play around with the technology and needing to understand how it works for yourself (which you may or may not have help in doing). This class offered me occasions to learn many common technologies and in such a way that forced me to teach myself and (on occasion) find additional resources outside of those provided to assist me. Tools Learned HTML CSS GitHub Wordpress.com DITA XML Markdown MkDocs The Good The Not So Good What's next? As a graduating senior, this is an interesting question. I won't be taking anymore classes about digital technologies, at least not for a while. However, this class has shown me that I will always be learning. No matter what job I have in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future, chances are I will need to learn new digital technologies.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"reflection/#course-reflection","text":"Over the course of this class, there has been a steady learning curve.
