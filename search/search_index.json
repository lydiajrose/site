The two below are the ones I found the most rewarding. DITA Project In working on my DITA project I not only learned a lot about new tools, but also about writing process information. In order for you to document a process in DITA, you have to break the process up into smaller portions since DITA tasks are only used for specific functions. This means that certain DITA tasks won't accept certain types of content, forcing you to split things up and not put everything into a singular DITA task. DITA literally requires you to formulate the process in a more bite-sized, digestible portions. Click on the link below to view a PDF version of my final DITA project. DITA Project MN Austin Healey Club Website One of the most rewarding projects that we did this semester was revamping the MN Austin Healey Club's website. As you can see below, the original site was functional, but rather busy and not the most streamlined or aesthetic. Our main goal in our redesign was to make the website as user friendly as possible since most of the potential users of the site tend to be older and not always the most technically savvy. We also needed a site that was more mobile friendly. As it was, the original site had a fixed size and would not adjust to the size of the user's browser window. This made using the site somewhat tedious. Our final product was not perfect (in no small part to the limitations of our chosen CMS Wordpress.com), but I feel that we were still able to make significant improvements to the overall site.

Looking back I'm a little shocked by how many new tools and skills I learned in such a short amount of time. Looking over my first ever assignment for this class, I realized just how far I've come. The New Digital Literacy I had mentioned in my initial Digital Literacy narrative that it is difficult to use or write documentation about technology when you have never used it before. You often find yourself needing to play around with the technology and needing to understand how it works for yourself (which you may or may not have help in doing). This class offered me occasions to learn so many common technologies and in such a way that forced me to learn not only from the provided resources, but also from using them myself and watching my classmates use them. While I don't think a whole lot has changed (outside of me learning the digital technologies that I have listed below), I feel that I have learned how to learn better. Tools Learned HTML CSS GitHub Wordpress.com DITA XML Markdown MkDocs The Good & the Difficult There are a few things I could put here, but I think that the best part of this class were the skills that I didn't expect to learn. Coming into this class I knew I would be learning HTML and CSS and all of the other tools I mentioned, I didn't know I'd also be learning project management and process documentation and self-teaching. One of the most game changing things I learned was that I learn far better by doing and by watching other people rather than just reading a block of text. For the first portion of class I kept forcing myself to do the readings, but I slowly realized that they often confused me or weren't helpful (at least at that moment and when taken in all at once). As I realized this, I began to play around more with the tools we were learning and then use the readings as references when I got stuck. This was far more efficient and kept me from getting bogged down with details that weren't relevant to the projects that I was doing. I honestly wish I had learned this sooner in the process because this class might have been a little bit easier if I had. What's next? As a graduating senior, this is an interesting question. I won't be taking anymore classes about digital technologies, at least not for a while. However, this class has shown me that I will always be learning. No matter what job I have I will need to learn new digital technologies and this class has given me plenty of resources to learn them on my own. Additionally, it's allowed me to completely build and/or at least have a baseline for projects that I can put into a professional portfolio. Especially as a wannabe technical writer who hopes to create documentation on how to use new products, how am I supposed to get people to learn when I don't understand how to learn myself? In short, I'll always me learning so that I can always do the best job that I can.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"reflection/#course-reflection","text":"Over the course of this class, there has been a steady learning curve.
